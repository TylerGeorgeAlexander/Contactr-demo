## Technology Stack:

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport.js, bcrypt, Bootstrap

The back-end of this application was crafted using Node.js and the Express framework, proficiently handling all routes and controller logic. We chose EJS as our templating engine for the View, with MongoDB and Mongoose driving our database and Model logic. For authentication, we relied on Passport.js, while bcrypt secured user passwords with salting and hashing. Lastly, Bootstrap was employed to refine the front-end aesthetics.
